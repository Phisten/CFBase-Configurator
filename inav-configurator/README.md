# INAV Configurator

INAV Configurator is a crossplatform configuration tool for the [INAV](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav) flight control system.

It runs as an app within Google Chrome and allows you to configure the INAV software running on any supported INAV target.

Various types of aircraft are supported by the tool and by INAV, e.g. quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters and fixed-wing aircraft.

## Authors

Konstantin Sharlaimov/DigitalEntity - maintainer of the INAV firmware and configurator. 

INAV Configurator was originally a [fork](#credits) of Cleanflight Configurator with support for INAV instead of Cleanflight.

This configurator is the only configurator with support for INAV specific features. It will likely require that you run the latest firmware on the flight controller.
If you are experiencing any problems please make sure you are running the [latest firmware version](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/releases).
